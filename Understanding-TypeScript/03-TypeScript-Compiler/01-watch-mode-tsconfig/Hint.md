Watch mode will enable typescript compile (tsc) to watch the project folder and the automatically recompile the file whenever a change is made

# Setting up the watch mode

- Initializes and creates tsconfig.json

tsc --init

Thus after setting tsc --init, we can then simply run the command "tsc" without specifying the filename.

Running "tsc" will compile all the .ts file in the project folder

# Entering Watch mode

tsc --watch

OR

tsc -w

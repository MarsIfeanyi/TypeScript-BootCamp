/**
 *
 * TypeScript is all about type safety
 *
 * What TypeScript does:
 *
 * 1. Static Checking: Whenever you are writing code the syntax is constantly being checked by the IDE
 *
 * Hint: The whole job of TypeScript is simply to analyze the code as we type.
 *
 * Typescript is a development tool, your code still runs on pure JS
 *

 *
 *
 *
 * INSTALLATION OF TYPESCRIPT
 *
 * First you will install typescript globally, then as you work on a project you will install it as a dev dependency.
 *
 * sudo npm install -g typescript
 *
